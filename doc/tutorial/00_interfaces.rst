Interfaces
----------

LASIF defines a project via its directory structure. The state of the
directory is the state of the inversion project. LASIF currently exposes two
interfaces to interact with it. They are complementary and to get the most
out of LASIF users are advised to use both.


Command Line Interface
======================

LASIF's primary interface is its command line interface. Please read at least
the introduction to the :doc:`../cli` before proceeding.


Web Interface
=============

The web interface is a recent addition to LASIF and is intended to aid users
with data exploration and discovery. Please refer to the
:doc:`../webinterface` for more information.
